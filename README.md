# Introduction 

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome\!

This graph was created using `rover init`. 

`rover init` helps you set up a new, federated GraphQL API using [Apollo Connectors](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/schema-design/connectors) and an example REST API.

This command:

* Creates a set of template files in your current directory
* Generates the credentials your GraphQL API will need to interact with Apolloâ€™s GraphOS platform
* Provides a starter schema to help you design your GraphQL API
* Walks you through spinning up a local environment to test your API


ðŸ““ **Note:** If youâ€™re already logged into an existing Apollo organization by the time you run this command, the CLI will nudge you to go to GraphOS Studio. From there, you can create a new personal API key to interact with Rover. If you donâ€™t have an account yet, visiting the link will prompt you to create one.
